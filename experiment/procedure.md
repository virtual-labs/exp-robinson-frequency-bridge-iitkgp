#1 Connect the bridge as per diagram.
                Keep 
                 \[R_4 = 2*R_3 (say R_3 = 1000 \Omega )\]
                Set the dial of the signal generator to read 500 Hz. Apply the signal generator voltage to the bridge.
                Keep
                \[C_1 = C_2 = 0.1 \mu F\]
                and adjust resistance R<sub>4</sub> and R<sub>3</sub>
                together such that they always read the same value and at balance note the component values and calculate the frequency by
                \[F_c = \frac{1}{2 \pi RC} where\]
                 \[R = R_1 = R_2 and\]
                \[C = C_1 = C_2\]
                The percentage error between stimulated bridge frequency (F<sub>d</sub>) and the (voltage) source frequency (F<sub>s</sub>) is calculated
                with respect to F<sub>d</sub> as
                 \[\%Error = \frac{(F_d - F_c) *100}{F_d}\]
                where F<sub>d</sub> is also called the dial frequency. Repeat procedure for various dial frequencies.
                
                
 <br/>
 #2 Set the values of the components to give balance of a setting of 1000 Hz. Note the reading of the detector for different dial frequencies on either side in small steps, keeping the output amplitude of the signal generator constant. Draw
                a graph showing the relation between the unbalanced voltage vs. dial frequency.
